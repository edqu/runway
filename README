Runway 0.1a
Robert M. Hall, II - http://www.impossibilities.com/

Runway is a set of Python, Flash/ActionScript 3, and JavaScript helpers for leveraging data from LeapMotion input device - http://leapmotion.com/

Current State as of 11/27/2012:

	1. Functioning Python Socket server "Runway" to collect data from LeapMotion device, and push out over a local socket port 8888.
	2. Functioning Flash library to connect via sockets to Runway Socket Server and allow push of data in realtime for use in ActionScript 3
	3. Demo Flash file showing interaction
	
TODO:
	1. Add support for additional "hands" in Runway - currently only supports first hand present
	2. Additional refinements and data points in Runway Python socket server, and AS3 bridge classes
	3. Add externalInterface bridge API in Flash to allow JavaScript communication - great for supporting older browsers with no websockets, or native plugins for LeapMotion
	4. Websocket based JavaScript lib to match Flash/AS3 functionality for modern browsers
	5. Native Extension for Adobe AIR for Mac/PC to use native LeapMotion SDK to poll/collect data from LeapMotion for use in AS3/AIR apps.
