Runway 0.1a
Robert M. Hall, II - http://www.impossibilities.com/

Runway is a set of Python, Flash/ActionScript 3, and JavaScript helpers for leveraging data from LeapMotion input device - http://leapmotion.com/

Current State as of 11/29/2012:

	1. Functioning Python Socket server "Runway" to collect data from LeapMotion device, format into JSON and push out over a local socket port 8888.
	2. Functioning Flash library to connect via sockets to Runway Socket Server and collecte JSON data for use in ActionScript 3
	3. Demo Flash file showing interaction, finger tip data rendering
	
TODO:
	1. Add support for additional "hands" or "tools" in Runway - currently only supports first hand present
	2. Additional refinements and data points in Runway Python socket server, and AS3 bridge classes (Learn more Python!)
	3. Add externalInterface methods to allow SWF to run faceless and act as a bridge to JavaScript - great for supporting older browsers with no websockets, or native plugins for LeapMotion
	4. Websocket based JavaScript lib to match Flash/AS3 functionality for modern browsers - see great example Leapfrog here using websockets, JSON and Processing:  https://github.com/tylerwilliams/leapfrog
	5. Native Extension for Adobe AIR for Mac/PC to use native LeapMotion SDK to poll/collect data from LeapMotion for use in AS3/AIR apps.
